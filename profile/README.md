# 🌊 Danube Messaging

**Danube is an open-source, distributed messaging broker system, built in Rust**

Danube aims to be a lightweight yet powerful, secure and scalable messaging platform, suitable for event-driven applications. 
Sub-second dispatch + cloud economics. Self-contained brokers with embedded Raft consensus. Two modes: best-effort pub/sub or at-least-once streaming with WAL + object storage

## ⚡ Why Danube?
 
### 🌩️ **Cloud-Native Stateless Architecture**
Zero external dependencies, metadata replicated across brokers via embedded Raft consensus (openraft), data in WAL + S3/GCS/Azure. Scale horizontally in seconds without data migration.
Add or remove brokers with minimal disruption. Infinite retention without local disk limits using opendal.
 
### 🎯 **Self-Optimizing Clusters**
Intelligent load management continuously monitors broker health and automatically rebalances topics to prevent hotspots. New topics land on the least-loaded broker. Workload changes? The cluster adapts without manual intervention.

### 🤖 **AI-Native Administration**
Manage your cluster through natural language with Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf. 32 intelligent tools accessible via Model Context Protocol (MCP), create topics, analyze lag, troubleshoot issues, query metrics, all by conversation. CLI, Web UI, or AI: your choice.

### 🔥 **Two-Speed Dispatch**
- **Non-Reliable**: Zero persistence, sub-millisecond latency for real-time metrics and live telemetry
- **Reliable**: At-least-once delivery with WAL + cloud durability for critical workloads
 
### 📋 **Built-In Schema Registry**
Centralized schema versioning with compatibility enforcement across JSON Schema, Avro, and Protobuf. Prevent schema drift and invalid messages before they reach consumers. Single source of truth for your data contracts.
 
### 🔌 **Pure Rust Connector SDK**
Plug-and-play integrations with MQTT, databases, Kafka, ClickHouse, vector databases, and more. Framework isolated from broker core—build connectors without touching cluster internals.
